## Features

The Jimmy Vela's portfolio site upon launch has a clean hero section. A picture
of Jimmy with a cool css animation and links to Jimmy's LinkdIn and GitHub
profile. Users can download a pdf of Jimmy's recent resume and jump to the
contact section to send Jimmy a message. There's an About Me section to get to
know more about Jimmy. The Skills section shows the skills that have been
learned by Jimmy and a verify button that takes the user to a credly page to
verify Jimmy's credentials by Southern Methodist University. A Portfolio section
with projects Jimmy has worked on with buttons to jump to web page and GitHub
repository.

## Process

1. Install necessary dev dependencies.
2. Upon launch have a loader welcoming a user.
3. Create Hero section. The hero section will have a picture of Jimmy and have a
   cool CSS animation for the image. Next to the picture have a call-to-action
   area with links to LinkdIn and GitHub profile. Have a button for users to
   download a pdf of Jimmy's resume. A button to jump to contact section and a
   button to scroll down to next section. Background will be interactable
   particle effect from react-tsparticles.
4. Create a fixed navbar that jumps a user to sections of the page. If a smaller
   media device than fix the navbar to the bottom of the page with a toggle menu
   option.
5. Create an About Me section that has another image of Jimmy and a summary
   about him.
6. Design a creative skills section. Using a svg and css design a creative
   display of skills. Underneath separate and display some of Jimmys frontend,
   backend and other skills. Create a button that upens a modal asking the user
   if they wish to go to the credly page to verify Jimmyâ€™s skills.
7. In the Portfolio section create links to deployed website and github repos to
   projects that Jimmy has worked on.
8. Create a contact section to contact Jimmy via phone call or a message through
   emailJs. Bring a modal of an iphone using ThreeJs and have it rotated.
9. Style page and components using CSS.
10. Launch on hostzinger.
